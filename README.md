# Disney Movie Data Scrape
In this project, I complete the data science steps to create a dataset from scratch. The dataset contains all the information found on each Disney movies' Wikipedia information box.
<br /> <br /> Movie List: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney_Pictures_films

## Libraries/Helpers
- Data Scraping: BeautifulSoup, Requests
- Save/Load Files: JSON, Pickle, CSV, Pandas
- API: The Open Movie Database (http://www.omdbapi.com)
- Others: urllib, os, datetime, RegEx

Pytest from [helper](https://github.com/marcowong3/scrape-disney-movie/tree/main/helper) was used in Task 3 to convert monetary strings to numerical values

## Tasks Outline
### Task 1
Build a script to access the information box found on a movie's Wikipedia page. 
### Task 2
Build a script to access all movies' information box found in Movie List url.
### Task 3
Clean Data, Test Code with Pytest
### Task 4

Save data as JSON/CSV.

## Result
The final datasets ready for analysis are formatted as CSV, JSON and Pickle are found at [this folder](https://github.com/marcowong3/scrape-disney-movie/tree/main/disney_data_final) <br/>
